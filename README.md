# Microsleep Detection
a CNN model with transformer reliability 

## Data
Is available at [OSF](https://osf.io/pq7vb/)

## Description
This a project for comparision between accuracy and loss of different approaches to problem of detecting microsleep from 1st stage of sleep data; somehow conclusion of this research is to show how much microsleep and 1st stage of sleep is similar to eachother.

## Advantage
Our best procedure had lower loss than best work done in this problem and got published as an article; this advantage is due to using transformer.
